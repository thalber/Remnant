It's been a while, hasn't it, rat? Welcome back.
Do you wander a familiar world? Or has it decayed even beyond your recognition?
I was once the Count of 2 living blocks, esteemed by my peers. All of whom are gone, of course.<LINE>So are yours, believe me.
When both the world and my body were still pristine, this is the very place where I meditated in the early morning.
Corporeal matters seem so distant now. What I wouldn't give to go back, to feel the warm rays of <LINE>sunlight on my face and breathe the cool, clean air.
You have a very special opportunity. Cherish this chance. See the beauty that still lives even now.
Change your fate.
