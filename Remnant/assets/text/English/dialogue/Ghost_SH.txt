You had no name.
We once had! We were your noble benefactors,<LINE>standing golden and gleaming over the pitiful world we clawed our way out of.
So proud. Am I supposed to be ashamed?
It's not fair! Being reduced to this humiliating state for basic pride...
All the jubilation, the singing of my name, did it all mean nothing? I don't deserve this!
I've been left to stew and rot in emotional turmoil for eternity. Then, you appear.
You get a second chance. Of all the great poets, genius debaters,<LINE>and fashion legends, a disgusting, simple beast is chosen.
Your very existence spits in the face of my entire race. And despite that, I envy you.
