Did you hear me, calling out to you, through the buzzing in the air?
That resonating hum of a thousand thousand voices, long dead, others just like us.
But you're different. You're very special. I could hear your voice above the rest, deliberate and intent.
And of all, you chose to commune with me! What a fascinating predicament you're in...
Sadly our brief connection is almost adjurned. Visit again sometime, will you?
It's been too long since any of us could speak.
