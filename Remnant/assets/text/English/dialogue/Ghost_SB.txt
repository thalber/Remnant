The little ghost! Not as trapped as us, I see?
Up from the depths you came as many others before you, drawn from the void again and again, an endless drip drip drip.
Though I've not felt such a unique presence in some time!
Yours, however, is much weaker than that long ago eruption from the sea.
I did not get to meet it, but at least you're here now! I yearn to know, what more secrets could the abyss hold?
But my time for study has passed. If only we waited until we know more! 
Fools... We should have drilled deeper!
